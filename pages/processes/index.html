					<h2>Using the Othermill</h2>
						<h3>1 - Setup material in Otherplan</h3>
							<p>Select the copper plate you will be using, and measure it's width and height with a ruler. Then [IMPORTANT] measure it's thickness with calipers.</p>
							<p>In the top right corner of Otherplan, you can Setup Material. Select double-sided FR-1, and enter the dimensions you measured earlier.</p>
						<h3>2 - Load design and bits</h3>
							<p>Drag and drop your Eagle .brd file into Otherplan, and your design will appear in 3d model and as a new entry on the right side. Add all the bits you will be using for this board (aka 1/32", 1/16")</p>
						<h3>3 - Inspect and adjust Eagle file</h3>
							<p>With the correct bits selected, carefully look over your design and check to see if any traces are too close, or any holes are too small they won't be drilled</p>
							<p>To fix any problems, keep Otherplan open, and also open the Eagle file to edit. Adjust your traces, or drop new holes, and press SAVE in Eagle. You can then press the refresh key on your file in Otherplan, and the changes will appear.</p>
						<h3>4 - Connect to Othermill</h3>
							<p>Once your file is ready to be milled, you can start using the machine.</p>
							<p>Power the Othermill on, and connect to your laptop over the USB cable. Otherplan should now say that you are connected to a mill, and can control it.</p>
						<h3>5 - Prepare copper place</h3>
							<p>The Othermill is designed to hold plates 5"x4". If your board is larger than this, you can cut it to size in the shop.</p>
							<p>Apply double-sided tape to the bottom of your board, and press if firmly down onto the Othermill's bed. Press firmly and for about 30 seconds, making sure that the tape fully stuck and <strong>flat</strong> to the aluminum bed.
						<h3>6 - Change Tool and home</h3>
							<p>The top-right of Otherplan will show what bit it <strong>thinks</strong> is currently connected. This might not be a bit your using, or could just be completely wrong, the machine's not that smart.</p>
							<p>Select Change Tool, and follow the instructions. You should add the smallest bit your job is using (aka 1/32"), and follow the instructions for homing. Each every time you change the bit, you must re-home the Z-axis.</p>
						<h3>7 - Run Job</h3>
							<p>Once correct bit is setup, your material is ok, you can press "Start Cutting!". While the job is running, do not listen to headphones, and do not leave the machine alone.</p>
							<p>If your job is using multiple bits, the machine will automatically stop and ask you to change bits. Follow the instructions just like before, and it will continue with the job.
						<h3>8 - Remove and clean</h3>
							<p>Once the job is finished, use a vacuum to clean both your board and the <strong>entire</strong> insides of the Othermill (including those hard-to-reach places in the top).</p>
							<p>Scrub your board with a scour pad to remove any roughness and copper hairs, and test all connections with a multimeter</p>
				</div>
				<div class="contentBlock" id="toner-transfer">
					<h2>Toner Transfer</h2>
						<h3>1 - Make the printout</h3>
							<p>Hide all layers in your Eagle .brd file, and only show the layers that you want to remain after acid etching. These usually include Top (or Bottom), Pads, Vias, and Dimension.</p>
							<p>When only those are visible, File->Print and save as a PDF file. Make sure you have the "Solid" and "Black" options checked. If you are etching onto the Top of your board, also select "Mirror" and your design will flip horizontally. If you are etching onto the Bottom of your board, leave it unselected.</p>
							<p>Use Illustrator or similar software to place your design on the sheet, or to make multiple copies of your design for one sheet. Print your design onto transfer paper using the laser printer in the hard-lab. If using the blue transfer paper, make sure you are printing onto the glossy side of the sheet.</p>
						<h3>2 - Laminate</h3>
							<p>Before applying ink to your copper plate, make sure your board is shiny and clean. Scrub off any dirt with a scour pad, and then clean it with isopropyl rubbing alcohol and dry off.</p>
							<p>Place your printed design face-down onto your copper place and align with any holes you might have already drilled. Once aligned, add a small piece of tape to one side of the paper so that it doesn't shift in the laminator.</p>
							<p>Heat the laminator up to it's 5-mil setting. This takes about 5 minutes, so start heating it up early. Firmly hold your paper to the board so it doesn't move, and slowly feed it through the laminator. Do this 5-10 times (sometimes longer!)</p>
						<h3>3 - Water and remove paper</h3>
							<p>When done laminating, place the board and paper still stuck together in a tupperware container with <strong>cold</strong> water in it. Leave for a couple minutes, or until the transfer paper floats away from the copper plate. Peel back the paper, and your traces should be written in black ink on your copper plate.</p>
							<p>What happened is you heated copper plate and ink so that it melts onto the copper. Not hot enough, and only part of your design will transfer to the copper. Too hot, and the ink will start to bubble on the copper. If you don't heat it for the right amount of time and the transfer doesn't work, simply rub off the ink with a scour pad, and start again.</p>
						<h3>4 - Air-dry and fix with sharpie</h3>
							<p>Do not touch the toner, as it is still soft can move around. To dry the board off, use a hair dryer from the shop, and try not to let anything touch your design.</p>
							<p>If there are any spots on your design missing some ink, you can simply use a permanent black marker to correct the mistake. You could even skip the entire toner transfer process, and simply draw onto a copper plate with permanent marker!</p>
				</div>
				<div class="contentBlock" id="acid-etching">
					<h2>Acid Etching</h2>
						<h3>1 - Prepare board</h3>
							<p>As mentioned in the toner transfer section, you can fix any mistakes in your design with a permanent maker. Apply the marker to a dry plate, and try to spread the ink thick so it fully covers the copper.</p>
						<h3>2 - Prepare acid</h3>
							<p>If you are using [muriatic acid + hydrogen peroxide], measure them at a 1-2 ratio (aka 1/4 cup of muriatic acid, and 1/2 cup of hydrogen peroxide), and make sure to <strong>first</strong> add the hydrogen peroxide, then <strong>second</strong> add the muriatic acid to your tupperware container. It should be a clear color before you etch.</p>
							<p>If you are using ferric chloride, simply pour from the gallon container of pre-mixed acid into your tupperware container. It should be brown before you etch.</p>
						<h3>3 - Etch and Shake</h3>
							<p>With a second container of water next to it and wearing rubber gloves, add your copper plate to the acid. Mix the acid constantly by gently lifting one side, causing a wave pattern to move back and forth. With a rubber glove on, you can remove and inspect the plates. Once they are etching, they will start turning pink or purple.</p>
							<p>Eventually all your visible copper will disappear. How long this takes depends on the intensity of the acid. The muriatic acid mixture can be very fast right after mixing, and will eventually turn green/blue as it absorbs the copper. The ferric chloride can take more time, and will start turning green as it absorbs copper.</p>
						<h3>4 - Clean up and finish</h3>
							<p>When your board is finished etching, remove it from the acid and put it in your water container. Pour your used acid into one of the "old acid" buckets. That stuff is now filled with copper, and is bad for the environment and cannot simply be thrown away.</p>
							<p>Rinse out your tupperware containers and board in the slop sink, making sure to rinse away any tiny amounts of acid that might be in the sink. Dry your board with a hair dryer, then remove the black ink with a scour pad.</p>

				<div class="contentBlock" id="solder-mask">
					<h2>Dry-Film Solder Mask</h2>
						<h3>1 - Design the printout</h3>
							<p>Our solder mask will cover everything except the places where we need to solder something. Those spots have their own layers in Eagle, call ehd tStop and bStop layers. If I'm making a mask for the top of my board, then I'll hide every layer except the tStop layer, and save as a PDF. Make sure you have the "black" and "solid" options checked.</p>
							<p>You can then further design your tStop printout by opening the PDF in software like Illustrator. You can place the ink anywhere on the paper, and copy and paste the design to make multiple copies.</p>
						<h3>2 - Print on transparency paper</h3>
							<p>ITP uses laser printers, and most transparency papers will melt and destroy a laser printer. You need to make sure you are using transparency paper specifically designed to go through a laser printer!.</p>
							<p>Use this transparency paper to print your tStop layer in black ink. If any spots come out too thin, you can thicken the ink with a permanent marker.</p>
						<h3>3 - Clean and test board</h3>
							<p>Before adding a solder mask to you board, you'll want to make sure all your traces and holes are correct and not bridging. Scrub with a scour pad, and use a multimeter to beep-test all connections. Once the solder mask is added, this sill be more difficult to test.</p>
						<h3>4 - Laminate film</h3>
							<p>Cut out a piece of green dry-film solder mask large enough to cover your copper traces. The film as two sides, one shiny and smooth, the other duller and matte. Peel off the plastic on the dull/matte side to expose the adhesive. Press the film ontop of your copper traces, and rub all over to remove any air bubbles.</p>
							<p>Pass your copper plate through the heated up laminator, with the film stuck stuck on. The laminator melts the adhesive on the film, letting it stick better to the copper plate. After about 4 passes through, quickly run your board under cold water to quickly cool the adhesive and strengthen the bond.</p>
						<h3>5 - Align and expose to UV</h3>
							<p>Take your transparency with the black tStop or bStop layer, and align it to your board. Place in the UV exposure unit, and make sure the transparency stays aligned. Expose the board to UV light to cure all the solder-mask that's not under black ink.</p>
							<p>The amount of time it takes for this exposure step depends on the intensity of the UV expsosure unit. UV exposure units must be tested to find their best value, and given a label to indicate times.</p>
						<h3>6 - Leave in dark for 30 minutes</h3>
							<p>After exposing to UV light, leave your board in a dark place for about 30-60 minutes. It has been said that this is an important step in creating the best results.</p>
						<h3>7 - Develop</h3>
							<p>Fill a tupperware container with warm/hot water, and add 1/2 a spoon full of sodium carbonate (a white powder). Add your plate to the container. Using a toothbrush or similar, gently rub your boad to help the developer.</p>
							<p>After a few seconds, you should start to see your tStop or bStop layers revealed through the dissolving solder mask. Continue developing and gently brushing for another minute or so until the copper pads are fully revealed. Do not develop for too long, however, or you will remove more solder mask than you want to.</p>
							<p>When done, remove from the developer, clean under a water faucet, and dry with a hair dryer. Do not touch the solder mask, as it is still soft and can fall off.</p>
						<h3>8 - Cure under UV</h3>
							<p>To fully cure the solder mask, put it back under UV light for 5-20 minutes. This will make your solder mask dry and crispy. Aftewards, solder mask can be removed by simply scrapping at it with a sharp tool to expose the copper underneath.</p>

				<div class="contentBlock" id="stencil">
					<h2>Solder Stencil</h2>
						<h3>1 - Make the printout</h3>
							<p>A solder stencil is a sheet of material with holes cut out of it. These holes represent the parts of your design that solder paste should be on, and is assigned the Eagle layers tCream and bCream. If I'm making a stencil for the top of my board, I'll hide all layers except the tCream layer, then I'll save as a PDF. Make sure to select the "black" and "solid" options.</p>
							<p>The size of each hole needs to be shrunk by about 70% before we make the stencil. To do this is Illustrator, open the PDF, and select each shape in the design. Navigate to Object->Transform->Transform Each..., and a popup will appear. Scale the width and height of each shape by 70% each, and apply the changes. Now each hole should be smaller.</p>
						<h3>2 - Raster stencil</h3>
							<p>Inser a piece of transparency film into one of the Epilog laser cutters. Load your PDF file, and go into the Print options. Using the Epilog's driver, set the laser cutter's Job Type to "Raster," and set the rastering speed and power to low settings. On the 60 watt machine, speed=10 and power=10 work well, while on the 50 watt it seems speed=10 and power=15 works well.</p>
							<p>Send the job to the laser cutter, and run it. The laser cutter will slowly cut out your stencil line by line. If it doesn't cut through the material, the power should be set higher. If the edges of the holes are not clean and seem melted, the power should be set lower.</p>
						<h3>3 - Align and tape</h3>
							<p>Cut out your stencil, and align it with your PCB. If PCB is still attached to the larger copper plate, you can tape down the top of the stencil to the plate. If your PCB is fully cut out right now, squeeze your PCB between three other plates, one at the top, two at each side, and tape the stencil to the plate at the top. This helps keep the stencil flat when applying paste.</p>
						<h3>4 - Spread paste</h3>
							<p>Place a small line of solder paste along the top of you design so that it is the same width. Using a flat scraping tool like an old ID or credit card, firmly press and pull the paste over the entire stencil in one motion. This should press the paste through each hole in the stencil.</p>
							<p>Pull up the stencil and check your board to see that the sold spread correctly. If it didn't go well, you can simply clean the paste off and try again. When you are done with the stencil, be sure to scape off all un-used solder paste and put it back in the tub to be reused.</p>
						<h3>5 - Adjust with needle</h3>
							<p>If small changes need to be made, either removing or adding paste, you can use a sewing needle to adjust and move solder paste around. You could even apply paste to an entire board just using a needle, no stencil needed, but this takes a bit longer and is of less quality.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="contentBlock" id="smt-station">
					<h2>Using the SMT Station</h2>
						<h3>1 - Power on</h3>
							<p>The SMT Station has a large red switch along the right side, which will brighten up when turned on. The compresser as a red switch on its top, and when turned on will immediately begin filling the SMT Station with compressed air. Nothing else is needed to be done, because the compressor will automatically turn on and off when more air is needed.</p>
						<h3>2 - Place board</h3>
							<p>The the magnetic wedges to hold your PCB, and rest your forearm on the black arm rest. A light should be placed above the workspace to help visibility.</p>
						<h3>3 - Prepare parts</h3>
							<p>The SMT station can hold a wide array of parts, but you are likely to be using parts not found there. Before beginning your job, make sure that all components you need are present and able to be used. If you find that a compartment in the SMT Station needs to be refilled, please take initiative and fill it up.</p>
						<h3>4 - Pick and place</h3>
							<p>When you press down on a part with the nozzle, the station will turn on its suction to pickup the part. When you press down again, the suction will turn off. The nozzle will also rotate along with the rotary knob you use to guide the nozzle around.</p>
							<p>If you place a part wrong and have to redo it, I suggest fixing the part with a pair of tweezers. The solder paste on your board will be holding your part down, and the SMT Station is often times not strong enought to re-pick it up.</p>
						<h3>5 - Power down</h3>
							<p>Once finished placing your parts, put the nozzle in a safe position. Power down the SMT Station with the red power switch, and turn the compressor off with it's red switch. Clean up any parts, reel tape, or solder that is on the machine.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="contentBlock" id="heat-gun">
					<h2>Using the Heat Gun</h2>
						<h3>1 - Warm the board</h3>
							<p>A few minutes before reflowing your board, you should heat up the heat pad so that it is fully hot. Place your PCB with solder paste and components on the heat pad, and let is warm for a 1-2 minutes. This will soften the paste for better reflow.</p>
						<h3>2 - Set to around 240 degrees</h3>
							<p>Turn the heat gun on by setting both switches to ON, and set the temperature to 240 celsius. Solder paste melts around 200-240 degrees celsius, depending on the solder your using.</p>
						<h3>3 - Reflow</h3>
							<p>Carefully hold the heat gun facing down above your PCB, and slowly move it around about 1-2 cm above your board. After about 30 seconds, your solder paste will heat to the point of melting, and will turn a bright and shiny silver. Once all of your paste is shiny silver, heat for another 5 seconds, then put the gun away and power it OFF.</p>
						<h3>4 - Inspect and re-reflow</h3>
							<p>Inspect your solder joints for any bridges, tombstones, or incomplete connections. You can use the magnifying glass to get the best view of your board. If a part needs adjusting, you can re-heat the part with the heat gun, and while still heating it, adjust the with tweezers.</p>
