                    <h2>Using the OtherMill</h2>
                    <p class="classDate">Production #1</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://support.bantamtools.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001658214-Maintenance">Maintenance</a> and making sure ITP's mills don't break</li>
                            <li><a href="https://support.bantamtools.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003204926-Bantam-Tools-PCB-Badge">Hello World</a>: milling a simple PCB</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>1 - Load design and bits</h3>
                            <p>Drag and drop your Eagle .brd file into Otherplan, and your design will appear in 3d model and as a new entry on the right side. Add all the bits you will be using for this board (aka 1/32", 1/16")</p>
                        <h3>2 - Inspect and adjust Eagle file</h3>
                            <p>With the correct bits selected, carefully look over your design and check to see if any traces are too close, or any holes are too small they won't be drilled. (<a href="https://support.bantamtools.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003453943-Design-Considerations">link to Bantam Tool's Design Considerations</a>)</p>
                            <p>To fix any problems, keep Otherplan open, and also open the Eagle file to edit. Adjust your traces, or drop new holes, and press SAVE in Eagle. You can then press the refresh key on your file in Otherplan, and the changes will appear.</p>
                        <h3>3 - Connect to Othermill</h3>
                            <p>Once your file is ready to be milled, you can start using the machine.</p>
                            <p>Power the Othermill on, and connect to your laptop over the USB cable. Otherplan should now say that you are connected to a mill, and can control it.</p>
                        <h3>4 - <span class="green_color">Optional: </span>Attach Bracket and Locate</h3>
                            <p>This is only needed if you are doing a <a href="https://support.bantamtools.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001658814-Double-Sided-Boards">double-sided PCB</a>. Read <a href="https://support.bantamtools.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001658274-Locating-the-Bracket">Bantam Tool's guide for how to probe the bracket</a>.</p>
                        <h3>5 - Prepare copper plate</h3>
                            <p>The Othermill is designed to hold plates 5"x4". If your board is larger than this, you can cut it to size in the shop.</p>
                            <p>Apply double-sided tape to the bottom of your board, and press if firmly down onto the Othermill's bed. Press firmly and for about 30 seconds, making sure that the tape fully stuck and <strong>flat</strong> to the aluminum bed.
                        <h3>6 - Change Tool and Locate</h3>
                            <p>The top-right of Otherplan will show what bit it <strong>thinks</strong> is currently connected. This might not be a bit your using, or could just be completely wrong, the machine's not that smart.</p>
                            <p>Select Change Tool, and follow the instructions. You should add the smallest bit your job is using (aka 1/32"), and follow the instructions for locating. The bits must be located every time after they're inserted.</p>
                        <h3>7 - [New Feature] PCB Probe</h3>
                            <p>This is great. If you have the <a href="https://support.bantamtools.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001829134-Installing-and-Using-the-PCB-Probing-System">PCB Probing System</a>, then the machine can measure the thickness of your board for you. <a href="https://support.bantamtools.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001829134-Installing-and-Using-the-PCB-Probing-System">Read Bantam's guide</a> for how to use it.</p>
                            <p>Simply though, with the PCB probe touching your copper plate, go to <strong>Menu_Bar->BitBreaker->Probe_Material_Thickess</strong>.</p>
                            <p>
                                If your bit doesn't cut through the copper while cutting, it means some spots on your plate are thinner than others. When this happens, cancel your job, and got up to the <strong>Material</strong> box in the software and open the <strong>Size</strong> section. Lower the thickness by 0.05-0.1mm, so if mine was 1.52mm before, I'll change it to 1.50 or even 1.47. Press <strong>ENTER</strong> so the value is saved, then try milling again.
                            </p>
                        <h3>8 - Run Job</h3>
                            <p>Once correct bit is setup, and your material is ok, you can press "Start Cutting!". While the job is running, do not listen to headphones, and do not leave the machine alone.</p>
                            <p>If your job is using multiple bits, the machine will automatically stop and ask you to change bits. Follow the instructions just like before, and it will continue with the job.
                        <h3>9 - Remove and clean</h3>
                            <p>Once the job is finished, use a vacuum to clean both your board and the <strong>entire</strong> insides of the Othermill (including those hard-to-reach places in the top).</p>
                            <p>Scrub your board with a scour pad to remove any roughness and copper hairs, and test all connections with a multimeter</p>

                        <p>
                            Bantam Tool's has the feature of using an 30 degreen engraving bit to millout the a circuits traces. This is an amazing new feature that allows us to mill much much smaller traces and component pads.

                    <h2>Cleaning a Milled Copper Plate</h2>
                    <p class="classDate">Production #3</p>
                        <p><strong>[WARNING]</strong> The below video is old, and we now can mill double sided boards on the same plate. However, the same rules apply when cleaning it.</p>
