					<h2>Schematic + Board Commands</h2>
					<p>These commands can be used on both your schematic and board files</p>
					<h3>Info</h3>
					<p>Read and edit the many properties of whatever you click. For example, you can edit the coordinates of a part, or it's rotation, or it's name.</p>
					<h3>Move</h3>
					<p>Move a part or connection around. While moving, right-click to rotate the part at 90 degree intervals</p>
					<h3>Rotate</h3>
					<p>Click a part to rotate it 90 degrees. You can also change the degree that it will rotate (Board file only!) by changing the <strong>Angle</strong> parameter in the top-left toolbar</p>
					<h3>Change</h3>
					<p>This command can edit any property of what you use it on, it pretty much can do everything. For example, if I wanted to change the width of a route in my board file to 0.016", I would enter "change width 0.016", then click the route I want to change. If I want to change the value of a resistor in schematic file to 220 ohms, I would enter "change value 220" then click that resistor.</p>
					<p>If you are not sure of the options availabe to the <strong>change</strong> command, you can simply enter "change" and a dropdown menu will appear showing all your options.</p>
					<h3>Text</h3>
					<p>Simply writes some text, like a comment.</p>

					<h2>Schematic Commands</h2>
					<h3>Add</h3>
					<p>Load all libraries, where you can pick a new part to add</p>
					<h3>Delete</h3>
					<p>Click a part or a connection to delete</p>
					<h3>Net</h3>
					<p>Draw electrical connection between two pins</p>
					<h3>Copy</h3>
					<p>Copy a part or connection by clicking it</p>
					<h3>Name</h3>
					<p>Give a part or connection a name. Important to remember that any NETs with the same name will be treated as being connected together.</p>
					<h3>Value</h3>
					<p>Give a part a value, for example a resistance value "10k"</p>
					<h3>Label</h3>
					<p>Display the name of a NET (most useful for "wireless" connections)</p>

					<h2>Board Commands</h2>
					<h3>Route</h3>
					<p>Draw the traces that will become phyical copper traces. Turn those thing yellow "unrouted" lines to real traces, either on the Top (red) or Bottom (blue) layer.</p>
					<h3>Ripup</h3>
					<p>Remove a trace that was drawn with the "route" command. This does not delete a connection, but only removes the trace you drew for it.</p>
					<h3>Rats</h3>
					<p>Re-render the "ground-plane". This command also the added benefit of redrawing all the yellow connection lines to their closes neighbor, which is useful when first organizing your parts</p>
					<h3>Wire</h3>
					<p>Draw a line, most often used for drawing the <strong>Dimension</strong> outline</p>
