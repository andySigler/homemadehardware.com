                    <h3>Stuff</h3>
                    <h2>Populate with the SMT Station</h2>
                    <p class="classDate">Production #4</p>
                        <h3>1 - Power on</h3>
                            <p>The SMT Station has a large red switch along the right side, which will brighten up when turned on. The compresser as a red switch on its top, and when turned on will immediately begin filling the SMT Station with compressed air. Nothing else is needed to be done, because the compressor will automatically turn on and off when more air is needed.</p>
                        <h3>2 - Place board</h3>
                            <p>The the magnetic wedges to hold your PCB, and rest your forearm on the black arm rest. A light should be placed above the workspace to help visibility.</p>
                        <h3>3 - Prepare parts</h3>
                            <p>The SMT station can hold a wide array of parts, but you are likely to be using parts not found there. Before beginning your job, make sure that all components you need are present and able to be used. If you find that a compartment in the SMT Station needs to be refilled, please take initiative and fill it up.</p>
                        <h3>4 - Pick and place</h3>
                            <p>When you press down on a part with the nozzle, the station will turn on its suction to pickup the part. When you press down again, the suction will turn off. The nozzle will also rotate along with the rotary knob you use to guide the nozzle around.</p>
                            <p>If you place a part wrong and have to redo it, I suggest fixing the part with a pair of tweezers. The solder paste on your board will be holding your part down, and the SMT Station is often times not strong enought to re-pick it up.</p>
                        <h3>5 - Power down</h3>
                            <p>Once finished placing your parts, put the nozzle in a safe position. Power down the SMT Station with the red power switch, and turn the compressor off with it's red switch. Clean up any parts, reel tape, or solder that is on the machine.</p>
                    <h2>Reflow with the Heat Gun</h2>
                        <p class="classDate">Production #4</p>
                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_5lksMvmqQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        <h3>1 - Warm the board</h3>
                            <p>A few minutes before reflowing your board, you should heat up the heat pad so that it is fully hot. Place your PCB with solder paste and components on the heat pad, and let is warm for a 1-2 minutes. This will soften the paste for better reflow.</p>
                        <h3>2 - Set to around 240 degrees</h3>
                            <p>Turn the heat gun on by setting both switches to ON, and set the temperature to 240 celsius. Solder paste melts around 200-240 degrees celsius, depending on the solder your using.</p>
                        <h3>3 - Reflow</h3>
                            <p>Carefully hold the heat gun facing down above your PCB, and slowly move it around about 1-2 cm above your board. After about 30 seconds, your solder paste will heat to the point of melting, and will turn a bright and shiny silver. Once all of your paste is shiny silver, heat for another 5 seconds, then put the gun away and power it OFF.</p>
                        <h3>4 - Inspect and re-reflow</h3>
                            <p>Inspect your solder joints for any bridges, tombstones, or incomplete connections. You can use the magnifying glass to get the best view of your board. If a part needs adjusting, you can re-heat the part with the heat gun, and while still heating it, adjust the with tweezers.</p>
                    <h2>Adafruit Tutorials on SMD Manufacturing</h2>
                    <p class="classDate">Production #4</p>
                        <p><a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/smt-manufacturing/overview"><img style="border:solid 1px black" src="../img/adafruit-smd.png" /><br />Adafruit has a great set of tutorials</a> for handling SMD parts, but they're aimed at manufacturers rather than prototypers. Also we do things a little differently here, but still worth a read for if you end up doing small-scale manufacturing in the future.</p>
