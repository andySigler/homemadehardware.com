                    <h3>Stuff</h3>
                    <h2>Toner Transfer</h2>
                    <p class="classDate">Production #2</p>
                        <h3>1 - Make the printout</h3>
                            <p>Hide all layers in your Eagle .brd file, and only show the layers that you want to remain after acid etching. These usually include Top (or Bottom), Pads, Vias, and Dimension.</p>
                            <p>When only those are visible, File->Print and save as a PDF file. Make sure you have the "Solid" and "Black" options checked. If you are etching onto the Top of your board, also select "Mirror" and your design will flip horizontally. If you are etching onto the Bottom of your board, leave it unselected.</p>
                            <p>Use Illustrator or similar software to place your design on the sheet, or to make multiple copies of your design for one sheet. Print your design onto transfer paper using the laser printer in the hard-lab. If using the blue transfer paper, make sure you are printing onto the glossy side of the sheet.</p>
                        <h3>2 - Heat with Laminate and Iron</h3>
                            <p>Before applying ink to your copper plate, make sure your board is shiny and clean. Scrub off any dirt with a scour pad, and then clean it with isopropyl rubbing alcohol and dry off.</p>
                            <p>Place your printed design face-down onto your copper place and align with any holes you might have already drilled. Once aligned, add a small piece of tape to one side of the paper so that it doesn't shift in the laminator.</p>
                            <p>Heat the laminator up to it's 5-mil setting. This takes about 5 minutes, so start heating it up early. Firmly hold your paper to the board so it doesn't move, and slowly feed it through the laminator. Do this 5-10 times (sometimes longer!)</p>
                            <p>Once the transfer paper/vinyl is firmware stuck to the copper pad, you can stop laminating it and move on to a clothes iron. Put the iron on HIGH heat setting, and heat your toner paper/vinyl for 1-3 minutes under the iron. If you are heating a larger PCB that doesn't entirely fit under the iron, do an additional 1-3 minutes for each section of your PCB.</p>
                        <h3>3 - Water and remove paper</h3>
                            <p>When done laminating, place the board and paper still stuck together in a tupperware container with <strong>cold</strong> water in it. Leave for a couple minutes, or until the transfer paper floats away from the copper plate. Peel back the paper, and your traces should be written in black ink on your copper plate.</p>
                            <p>What happened is you heated copper plate and ink so that it melts onto the copper. Not hot enough, and only part of your design will transfer to the copper. Too hot, and the ink will start to bubble on the copper. If you don't heat it for the right amount of time and the transfer doesn't work, simply rub off the ink with a scour pad, and start again.</p>
                        <h3>4 - Air-dry and fix with sharpie</h3>
                            <p>Do not touch the toner, as it is still soft can move around. To dry the board off, use a hair dryer from the shop, and try not to let anything touch your design.</p>
                            <p>If there are any spots on your design missing some ink, you can simply use a permanent black marker to correct the mistake. You could even skip the entire toner transfer process, and simply draw onto a copper plate with permanent marker!</p>
                    <h2>Acid Etching</h2>
                    <p class="classDate">Production #2</p>
                        <p>Just watch the first half of this video...</p>

                        <h3>1 - Prepare board</h3>
                            <p>As mentioned in the toner transfer section, you can fix any mistakes in your design with a permanent maker. Apply the marker to a dry plate, and try to spread the ink thick so it fully covers the copper.</p>
                        <h3>2 - Prepare acid</h3>
                            <p>If you are using [muriatic acid + hydrogen peroxide], measure them at a 1-2 ratio (aka 1/4 cup of muriatic acid, and 1/2 cup of hydrogen peroxide), and make sure to <strong>first</strong> add the hydrogen peroxide, then <strong>second</strong> add the muriatic acid to your tupperware container. It should be a clear color before you etch.</p>
                            <p>If you are using ferric chloride, simply pour from the gallon container of pre-mixed acid into your tupperware container. It should be brown before you etch.</p>
                        <h3>3 - Etch and Shake</h3>
                            <p>With a second container of water next to it and wearing rubber gloves, add your copper plate to the acid. Mix the acid constantly by gently lifting one side, causing a wave pattern to move back and forth. With a rubber glove on, you can remove and inspect the plates. Once they are etching, they will start turning pink or purple.</p>
                            <p>Eventually all your visible copper will disappear. How long this takes depends on the intensity of the acid. The muriatic acid mixture can be very fast right after mixing, and will eventually turn green/blue as it absorbs the copper. The ferric chloride can take more time, and will start turning green as it absorbs copper.</p>
                        <h3>4 - Clean up and finish</h3>
                            <p>When your board is finished etching, remove it from the acid and put it in your water container. Pour your used acid into one of the "old acid" buckets. That stuff is now filled with copper, and is bad for the environment and cannot simply be thrown away.</p>
                            <p>Rinse out your tupperware containers and board in the slop sink, making sure to rinse away any tiny amounts of acid that might be in the sink. Dry your board with a hair dryer, then remove the black ink with a scour pad.</p>
