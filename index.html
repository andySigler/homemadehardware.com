					<h3>Soldering how-to</h3>
					<p>
						See the videos on how to do simple soldering in the <a href="./process/#soldering">in the soldering section</a> of the Process page
					</p>
					<p>
						If you are interested in seeing some more advanced stuff, check out Sparkfuns series of tutorials on soldering. It's mostly surface-mount examples, but the basic principals on how solder moves and what the common issues are the same with through-holes parts.
					</p>
					<h3>Eagle Schematics and Board Design</h3>
					<p>
						We went through some commands in class. Here are what we talked about, and a basic description:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>ADD</strong>: Load a new part into you Schematic (not available in Board design)
							</li>
							<br />
							<li>
								<strong>DELETE</strong>: Delete anything from your Schematic (restricted in Board design)
							</li>
							<br />
							<li>
								<strong>MOVE</strong>: Move anything around, and right-click to rotate (same in Schematic and Board design)
							</li>
							<br />
							<li>
								<strong>ROTATE</strong>: Rotate a part (restricted to 90degree rotations in Schematic design)
							</li>
							<br />
							<li>
								<strong>NET</strong>: Create an electrical connection between two PINs in Schematic design (not available in Board design)
							</li>
							<br />
							<li>
								<strong>COPY</strong>: Copy a part in your Schematic design (restricted in Board design)
							</li>
							<br />
							<li>
								<strong>ROUTE</strong>: [Board design only] Draw an electrical connection as a copper trace (1mm is good thickness)
							</li>
							<br />
							<li>
								<strong>RIPUP</strong>: [Board design only] Undo or remove a ROUTE that you have previously drawn
							</li>
							<br />
							<li>
								<strong>[SPACE-BAR DURING ROUTE]</strong>: [Board design only] Drop a "VIA" (a hole) while routing, so that your copper trace jumps to the other side of the board.
								<ul>
									<p>
										<strong class="green_color">NOTE</strong>: We will start with single-sided PCBs, so keep in mind that all "jumps" like this to the other side will end up being "air-wires"
									</p>

					<h3>Othermill</h3>
					<p>
						I've added a <a href="./process#othermill">checklist of what to do when using the Othermill</a> in the Process section of this website. Read through it while setting up your milling job. There is also a section on <a href="./process#bit-isolation">using Engraving Bits</a>, and a <a href="./process#sand-copper">video on cleaning copper plates</a>.</p>
						<p>Also you can look through <a href="https://support.bantamtools.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001656133-Welcome-to-the-Bantam-Tools-Desktop-PCB-Milling-Machine">this introduction to the machine by Bantam Tools</a>.

					<h3>Assemble Interactive Marquee Letter</h3>
					<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/255143041" width="640" height="400" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<h3>TIP120 Pinout</h3>
					<p>We will use a TIP120 transistor so that you can drive super bright LEDs if you'd like. Those require more current than your Arduino/ATtiny85 pin can output, so we use a transistor to turn on and off those higher currents.</p>

					<h3>Assemble our Marquee Sign</h3>
					<p>Great jog everyone, everyone's PCBs work!!! Find the sign assembled and hanging on the wall.</p>
					<h3>Larger AVR Microcontrollers</h3>
					<p>
						<a href="./boards/class_4.zip">Here is a zip file containing the boards from class, containing each of the below microcontrollers</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						The <strong>ATtiny84</strong> (<a href="https://www.digikey.com/products/en/integrated-circuits-ics/embedded-microcontrollers/685?k=ATtiny84&k=&pkeyword=ATtiny84&pv252=735&FV=1c0002%2C1f140000%2Cffe002ad%2C40196f&quantity=0&ColumnSort=0&page=1&stock=1&pageSize=25">on digikey</a>) is just like the ATtiny85, except it has more pins. The ATtiny84/85 are both fairly easy to solder down compared with other microcontrollers and modules.
					</p>
					<p>
						The <strong>ATMega328p</strong> (<a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/microchip-technology/ATMEGA328P-AUR/ATMEGA328P-AURCT-ND/3789455">on digikey</a>) is the most popular microcontroller around, it's what powers the Uno, Pro Mini, Adafruit Metro, and many others. It is difficult to solder down, but it's such a great chip that maybe you'll want to give it a try. Also, it does not support an "internal" clock, so you need to add a crystal or resonator to you circuit (we have 8mhz resonators in the cage).
					</p>
					<p>
						The <strong>ATMega32u4</strong> (<a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/microchip-technology/ATMEGA32U4-AUR/ATMEGA32U4-AURCT-ND/3440960">on digikey</a>) is very similar to the 328p, except it has hardware USB support, so it can act as a USB device.
					</p>
					<h3>Surface-Mount Packages</h3>
					<img src="./img/smd-size-chart.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" />
					<p>
						When selecting surface mount (SMD) components, it is important to pay close attention to the <strong>package</strong> (the shape) that the part comes in. If your components are not the same shape as in your Eagle file, then they will not be able to fit onto your PCB.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the image above, you can see that the ATtiny85's package is what's called an <strong>SO-8</strong> or <strong>SOIC-8</strong>. The ATtiny84's package is similar but with more pins, it's called an <strong>SO-14</strong> or <strong>SOIC-14</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						Also, the 3.3v 0.5A regulator that we have in the cage is an <strong>SOT-223</strong> package like in the picture above.
					</p>
					<p>
						Passive components are things like resistors, capacitors, and LEDs. We have many reels of these parts in the cage, all of which are <strong>0603</strong> SMD part sizes. So when ADD'ing parts to you schematic, make sure your passive components are 0603.
					</p>
					<h3>"Wireless" NETs in Schematic Files</h3>
					<p>
						NETS in Eagle Schematic files are the green lines that connect PINS together. Each NET has a unique name, like for example "VCC" and "GND". If two NETS are given the same name, then they are connected to each other, allowing you to "connect" PINS in your schematic without having to draw those lines.
						<ol>
							<li>Starting with an unconnected PIN, draw a small NET coming out of it connected to nothing else</li>
							<li>Right-click the NET, and select "Label" from the menu that pops up</li>
							<li>The name of that net will now show up and you can place it</li>
							<li>Right-click the NET again, and select "Name" from the menu</li>
							<li>Name it the same name as another NET in your schematic, and now they are connected</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<h3>Wireless Modules</h3>
					<p>See all information on modules in the <a href="./process#modules">modules section on the process page</a></p>
					<div class="green_color">
						<h3>For next class:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>This rescheduled class will be Monday morning, Feb 26th, at 9am in room 20 near the shop.</strong></li>
						</ul>
						<ul>
							<li>Bring the tweezers (which are <a href="./things">listed in the required tools section</a>) to class, we'll be working with surface-mount parts in class.</li>
						</ul>
						<ul>
							<li>Order any prototyping parts for your midterm project, and get you circuit/code/interaction working so you can start designing your PCB and ording parts.</li>
						</ul>

					<h3>Adding Ground-Plane in Eagle</h3>
					<p>
						A "ground-plane" is when, instead of ROUTE'ing your GND connections, you can draw a POLYGON that fills in the entire PCB with your GND signal. Ground-planes help shielding noise, cooling your circuit, and often times making production a little simpler.
					</p>
					<p>
						See the section on the Process page on <a href="./process#eagle-route">drawing a ground-plane in Eagle</a>.
					</p>
					<h3>Acid Etching PCBs</h3>
					<p>
						See the Process page for written instructions on <a href="./process#toner-transfer">how to do the toner transfer</a> at ITP. You will also find written instruction for
						<a href="./process#acid-etching">acid etching with muriatic acid</a>.
					</p>
					<h3>Place SMT Parts and Reflow Gun</h3>
					<p>
						See the Process page for written instructions on <a href="./process#heat-gun">using the heat-gun to reflow parts</a>, as well as some great
						<a href="./process#adafruit-smd">tutorials from Adafruit on working with SMD</a>. I recommend going through the following:
