                    <h3>Adding Ground-Plane in Eagle</h3>
                    <p>
                        A "ground-plane" is when, instead of ROUTE'ing your GND connections, you can draw a POLYGON that fills in the entire PCB with your GND signal. Ground-planes help shielding noise, cooling your circuit, and often times making production a little simpler.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The steps to draw a ground plane in your Eagle board file:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Select the <strong>POLYGON</strong> tool in your Eagle board view
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Set your grid to something not too small, I like 1mm. This is important because to complete a <strong>POLYGON</strong>, the final line must finish at the exact same point as the first line began.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Draw your <strong>POLYGON</strong> around your entire PCB, following the <strong>DIMENSION</strong> lines if you have already drawn those.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Finish by completing the shape (click the first line), and the <strong>POLYGON</strong> will turn into a dotted-line
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Select the <strong>NAME</strong> tool, and name the <strong>POLYGON</strong> "GND" so it is "connected" to your GND signals.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                To fill in your ground plane, enter the command <strong>RATSNEST</strong>. This will fill all possible ground signals with a plane of copper.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Check to make sure that all <strong>GND</strong> pads/pins are touching the ground-plane. If a pad/pin is isolated from the other grounds, then you will either need to re-route, or use VIAs to have all GND pads/pins touching the ground-plane.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
